# 🧪 Q2 2025 – My Software Testing Mastery Plan (C# Focused, Full Book Completion)

## 🧭 Goal  
In Q2 2025, I'm committing to reading **every chapter** of *Effective Software Testing* by Mauricio Aniche and applying the concepts through hands-on practice in my C# projects. My focus includes both **backend testing (xUnit + Moq)** and **frontend testing (bUnit)**. 

---

## 📘 Reading + Practice Schedule

| Week | Book Chapters | Focus |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Week 1** | Ch. 1–2 | Understand why testing matters, types of tests, the testing pyramid. Set up clean test projects. Reflect on past habits.  
| **Week 2** | Ch. 3 | Design and write clean, readable unit tests. Implement AAA pattern in xUnit.  
| **Week 3** | Ch. 4 | Apply the **testability** chapter: refactor code for easier testing. Practice testing private behaviors via public interfaces.  
| **Week 4** | Ch. 5–6 | Write tests for edge cases and use equivalence partitioning. Explore boundary testing and decision tables.  
| **Week 5** | Ch. 7–8 | Study control and data flow testing. Begin adding meaningful integration tests using real or in-memory databases.  
| **Week 6** | Ch. 9–10 | Explore test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies). Use **Moq** to isolate components. Start frontend testing with bUnit.  
| **Week 7** | Ch. 11–12 | Read about flaky tests and test smells. Clean up or refactor fragile tests in your own codebase. Continue with bUnit and test UX behavior.  
| **Week 8** | Ch. 13–14 | Learn about CI and testing culture. Integrate your tests with GitHub Actions. Write a “Testing Philosophy” README for your repo.

## 🧪 Weekly Practice Goals
- [ ] Set up isolated test projects for backend and frontend
- [ ] Use xUnit and Moq to cover core logic and services
- [ ] Build real-world test cases — not just toy examples
- [ ] Cover Blazor components using bUnit and DI patterns
- [ ] Integrate tests into CI with meaningful coverage

## 🎯 End-of-Quarter Goals (June 30, 2025)
- ✅ All 14 chapters of *Effective Software Testing* read and reflected on  
- ✅ Backend and frontend modules tested thoroughly using xUnit, Moq, and bUnit  
- ✅ CI pipeline runs all tests with visible coverage reporting  
- ✅ A clear, written philosophy and conventions for how I test software

TODO: Might be worth trying an app with blazor hybrid mode (wasm + server) and kill two birds with one stone. 
Check if possible to have app deployed, have pages with local data, and force a restard on the app. Front end data should remain intact.
Make a simple app to keep track of files. Like a file uploader thing
